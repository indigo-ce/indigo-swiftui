# Template Project TODOs

## Architecture Sync

Ordered by priority; where an item depends on an earlier one it says so. Each is
scoped to one focused pull request. Validate Swift changes with
`mise exec -- tuist generate --no-open` followed by `mise exec -- tuist build`;
do not rely on a simulator run.

### 1. Map the version build settings into the app's `Info.plist`

- [ ] **Gap.** `Configs/Debug.xcconfig` and `Configs/Release.xcconfig` set
      `MARKETING_VERSION=0.0.1` and `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION=1`, and
      `Core/Sources/Bundle+Extension.swift` ships `releaseVersionNumber`,
      `buildVersionNumber`, and `fullVersionString`, which read
      `CFBundleShortVersionString` and `CFBundleVersion` out of the Info.plist.
      Nothing connects the two: `App/Project.swift` passes
      `infoPlist: .extendingDefault(with:)` with only `UILaunchScreen`, so the
      bundle gets Tuist's defaults and the xcconfig values never reach it.
      Bumping the version in the xcconfig — the one place a clone would look —
      changes nothing the app can report.
- **Desired behavior.** The xcconfig is the single place a version is set, and
  the bundle reflects it.
- **Scope.** Add `"CFBundleShortVersionString": "$(MARKETING_VERSION)"` and
  `"CFBundleVersion": "$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)"` to the `.extendingDefault`
  dictionary in `App/Project.swift`. Do not change the values in either
  xcconfig, do not touch `Bundle+Extension.swift`, and do not add a plist to any
  framework target — only the app bundle carries a user-facing version.
- **Dependencies.** None.
- **Acceptance.** The generated app Info.plist under `App/Derived/InfoPlists/`
  (filename follows `appTarget`) contains both keys with the `$(…)` references,
  and a Debug build resolves `CFBundleShortVersionString` to `0.0.1`.
- **Validation.** `mise exec -- tuist generate --no-open`, then
  `rg 'MARKETING_VERSION|CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION' App/Derived/InfoPlists/`.
  Build with `mise exec -- tuist build` and read
  `CFBundleShortVersionString` back out of the built `Info.plist` with
  `plutil -p`.
